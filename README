Devel::Mallinfo is an interface to the C library mallinfo() function
giving malloc memory allocation statistics.  This is meant for
development use, to give you an idea of how much space your program
and any libraries are using from malloc().

The only prerequisites are a C compiler for the XS, and Perl version
5.6 or higher.  The Devel::Mallinfo home page is
