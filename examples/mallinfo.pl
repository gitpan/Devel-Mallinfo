# Usage: perl info.pl
#
# Print the hash of information returned by Devel::Mallinfo::mallinfo().
#
# In this program mallinfo() is the first thing done, so the values will be
# near the minimum for any Perl program.  You can see how many megs your
# actual program and libraries add to it!
#
# The printf has a hard-coded 10 chars for the names and 7 for the values,
# but you could find the widest of each at runtime if you wanted.
